== Deployment

This is a little checklist for the next release:

.Ordered
. create a release branch and change to it
. remove -SNAPSHOT in pom.xml
. build all artifacts:
  `mvn -B clean install source:jar javadoc:jar gpg:sign repository:bundle-create -Dgpg.passphrase=xx`
. use the script `src/script/deploy.sh` to upload bundles to https://oss.sonatype.org/
  (but don't forget to update the VERSION variable inside this script).
. after upload to the staging repository https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-8.ReleaseIt[release it]:
  select "Staging Repositories" on oss.sonatype.org, press "Refresh" and then "Close" and "Release".
. build the project page (`mvn site`) and transfer the site (`target/site`) to http://javatux.de/jfortune/
. checkin the pom.xml (if not already done), label the sources, e.g. with "jfortune-0.5" and push it (`git push --tags`)
. merge the release branch to master and develop branch
. change to develop branch and start next SNAPSHOT
. after a few days: check jfortune with http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22de.javatux.jfortune%22[search.maven.org]
